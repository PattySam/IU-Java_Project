This repository is for my Project Java Web Development class at IU of Applied Science class.

The web application will be a website for a sport club, basketball in particular. The 
target group will be the players, the staff and the fans of the club. On this website users 
will get information about the upcoming matches in every category, information about 
the results, knowledge about the clubâ€™s history, what is the main purpose of the club, 
and what players can gain from basketball into the real life. There will also be an online 
shop where the users can buy the jerseys of players, their posters, and signed 
basketballs.
 The user will be able to register for a newsletter with his/her email address where if 
there is something new coming up about the club, the user will be informed as soon as 
possible.
 At the bottom of the page there will be list of sponsors who are helping the club. 
The web application will be written in HTML and CSS. For the dynamic aspects I will 
be using JavaScript. That is for the front-end. As for the back-end I will be using Nodejs.
